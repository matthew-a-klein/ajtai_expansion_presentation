\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{What we are trying to do}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We start off with a relation made hard to 'break' based on the MSIS problem
        \item We will show that this relation is equivalent to two other relations, that can be used for folding
        \item We then adapt this equivalence to the Customisable Constraint System (CCS)
    \end{itemize}
