\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{What we are trying to do}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We start off with a relation made hard to 'break' based on the MSIS problem
        \item We will show that this relation is equivalent to two other relations, that can be used for folding
        \item We then bind these two other relations to the Customisable Constraint System (CCS)
        \item This allows for a folding scheme based on ajtai commitments and compatible with ccs
    \end{itemize}
